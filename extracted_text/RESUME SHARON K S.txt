AGE AND GENDER DETECTION:
Developed an Al-based system that directly captures images from camera and
predicts the user's age and gender using Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and
OpenCV. The system processes live facial inputs in realtime to classify
demographic attributes accurately . Pretrained models for face detection, age
prediction, and gender prediction were utilized in the process.
Tools Used: Python, OpenCV, Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Pretrained Models,
NumPy, and Matplotlib.
